# hangperson_game

This is a simple, fun game, written during my DataScience Bootcamp 2022-2023.
In addition to the core main game that was a mandatory exercise I added some optional functionalities:

	* A replay function, that asks the player if they want to play another round.
	* A list of possible words with randomized selection & removal of the chosen word from this list.
	* A joke message ("You have run out of free games. Subscribe to Hangperson now!") that is printed if the player goes through rounds until the list of words is empty.
